Notes:
1. Instructions for the setup of commute advisor backend is in the file "Commute advisor setup and execution.docx".  However there is no documentation for setting up the base webserver.  You are free to choose your favorite webserver platform, including something like a wamp or lamp server for testing.

2. The mongodb setup is documented in "mongodb setup.pptx".

3. The shortest path routines and network/graph analysis codebase is in the folder "commute_advisor_on_transit_and_pc_network". It also contains sample data in the subfolder "data_node_link" to do an initial test of the codebase.

4. The code to support LSTM based predictions is in the folder "Mongo Scripts".

5. Pre generated traces for transit are in the "trace_results" folder.  These are used by commute advisor for fast generation of transit and park-and-ride trips.
